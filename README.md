# Welcome to Digital Wellness Project
This is a project created by En En and Wei Jian, from NUS School of Computing for CP2106: Independent Software Development Project. Our aim of this project is to create something intuitive for users to manage their digital health. In this time of pandemic, many people have shifted to home-based learning, or work-from-home. The blurred boundaries of work-play time, unlike pre-Covid has caused digital usage to increased tremendously. Our application hopes to help users to have a healthier work-life balance with features such as Screen Usage Tracker, Steps Tracker, Workout Tutorials, and even a Focus Mode to block off your phone when doing work. 

# Information
